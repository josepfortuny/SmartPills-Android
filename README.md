# SmartPills-Android

## Use case

It is an android app where an user can plan in a calendar when a person has to take the pills, and to control and monitor a smartshower.
This is a project focused in penitentiary centers which can potentially use this as a tool to facilitate their work. 
So the user can plan the pills that a person has to take and visualize if it has physically taken [SmartPills-RaspyServer](https://github.com/josepfortuny/SmartPills-RaspyServer).

Also, the user can visualize from the smartshower [SmartPills-Arduino](https://github.com/josepfortuny/SmartPills-Arduino) the following variables:
* Water Intensity
* Water Temperature
* Fall detection
And also the user recieves a popup message in the when it detects a person falling in the shower.
