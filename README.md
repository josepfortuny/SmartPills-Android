# SmartPills-Android

# Use case

It is an android app where an user can plannify in a calendar when a person has to take the pills, and to controll and monitor a smartshower.
This is a project focused in penitentiary centers which can potentially use this as a tool to facilitate their work. 
So the user can plannify the pills that a person has to take and visualize if it has fisically taken [SmartPills-RaspyServer](https://github.com/josepfortuny/SmartPills-RaspyServer).
Also the user can visualize from the smartshower
